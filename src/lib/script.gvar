If the monster is capable of acting then the player should run `{ctx.prefix}dungeon auto` and wait at least 5 seconds after running this command for any other players to react. eg. to cast shield if they were hit

If a monster can see no adventurers or enemies to target then the monster takes the Search action. The monster rolls a perception check and an investigation check, and then the check with the higher modifier is used against the stealth check to determine if that enemy is found and is no longer hiding.

If a monster tries to do something that should be impossible. eg. moving after being opportunity attacked by a combatant with sentinel, then the player in control should override and resolve the monsters turn in the way that makes the most sense. You can review the monsters available actions by running `{ctx.prefix}i a` and choosing the first from the top that can be used or multiattack if the monster has that ability. If there is no logical choice how to resolve a monsters turn they take the Dodge action. `{ctx.prefix}dodge '<monster_name>'`.

The player in control should repeat this process until the intitiative reaches a player controlled combatant who then takes over."""

Alternatively, `{ctx.prefix}move` may be used to move your PC to a specific square, however `{ctx.prefix}go` is preferred.

You may also use the `{ctx.prefix}distance` command to measure the distance between any squares or combatants.
